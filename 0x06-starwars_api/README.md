## Script that Prints All Characters of a Star Wars Movie

The script takes the Movie ID as a positional argument. For example, to get the characters of "Return of the Jedi" (Movie ID: 3), run the script with `python script.py 3`.

The script will display one character name per line, in the same order as the "characters" list in the `/films/` endpoint of the Star Wars API.

To run the script, make sure you have the `request` module installed.
